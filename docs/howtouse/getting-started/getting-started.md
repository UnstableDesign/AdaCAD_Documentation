# Getting Started
AdaCAD is an experimental workspace that applies [parametric design](./glossary/parametric-design) to the domain of weave [drafting](./glossary/draft). It supports algorithmic and playful approaches to developing woven structures and cloth, for [shaft](./glossary/harness-loom), [dobby](./glossary/direct-tie-loom),  and [jacquard](./glossary/jacquard-loom) looms. 

## Step 1: Choose your AdaCAD Version
**AdaCAD is freely accessible online**, you do not need to download or install it on your computer. We recommend using the [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) browser on a laptop or desktop computer for the best experience. We are also continually updating AdaCAD to experiment with new features, which means that there is more than one version of AdaCAD that you can choose from. 

### AdaCAD 3 (Stable)

AdaCAD 3.0 is available at [https://adacad.org/](https://adacad.org/). This version is "stable" meaning that it has been tested extensively by the authors as well as the community. Learn more about using AdaCAD 3.0 on our:

-  [compare versions](./compare_versions.md) page.
-  [AdaCAD 3.0 interface overview](./interface.md) page.

### AdaCAD 4 (Beta)

AdaCAD 4.0 is available at [https://adacad-4-1.web.app/](https://adacad-4-1.web.app/). This is the "beta" version of the software which means that it is testing out new features and may have a few more bugs (which we rely on the community to tell us about!). You can do 99% of things you would do in AdaCAD 3.0 in 4.0 and we've added more operations as well as a new UI that makes it easier to toggle between drafting on point paper or by creating data flows on the workspace.

-  [AdaCAD 4.0 interface overview](./interface.md) page.

## Step 2: Create a Draft

No matter which version of AdaCAD you choose, you can create drafts two ways: 

1. You can create a "dataflow" by chaining [operations](../glossary/operation.md) together to generate a draft. This is an approach called [parametric design](./glossary/parametric-design). It applies algorithmic processes to weave draft construction--like writing code to generate drafts. The benefit of this approach is that it becomes easy to change and modify your drafts while still ensuring they follow certain rules. This is especially helpful for complex structure development. You can lean more about this process on the [make a dataflow help page](dataflow.md)

2. You can create a blank draft, specify the kind of loom you are drafting for, and click the cells much like you would fill in graph paper with pencil. This approach is modeled after more traditional methods of creating woven drafts. 


## Step 3: Weave! 

Once you have created a draft, weave it on your loom. You can export drafts from AdaCAD to upload to computerized looms such as the TC2 or AVL Compudobby Loom.

## Step 4: Share and Contribute

We'd love to see what you made and to share it with the community. Email your design and creation to unstabledesignlab@gmail.com or share it on Instagram by tagging [#adacad](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/adacad/). AdaCAD is an open-source project, hoping to blossom into an open-source eco-system, which means we are looking to the community to help develop this project. While we work to get more establish different modes of contribution you can help by sharing your designs with us, editing or updating our documentation (via the "Edit this Page" feature on the bottom of every page), [adding your own operations to AdaCAD](../../howtodevelop/makeanoperation.md) and providing feedback to us via unstabledesignlab@gmail.com. 



## Other Resources 
To make AdaCAD accessible to weavers and other weave-curious folks, we do our best to develop content that shows both how to use AdaCAD and offers exciting examples and artifacts generated in our research lab.
