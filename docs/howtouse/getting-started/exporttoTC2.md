# Weave AdaCAD Drafts on a TC2

The process is slightly different depending on which version you are using. Jump to the instructions for your version here: 

- [Export AdaCAD Drafts for Weaving on a TC2 (For AdaCAD 3)](#adacad-3)
- [Export AdaCAD Drafts for Weaving on a TC2 (For AdaCAD 4)](#adacad-4)


## AdaCAD 4

In AdaCAD 4, we are able to download bitmap images that can be directly loaded onto the TC2 (e.g. no need to convert the file format in Photoshop). The video below walks you though this process.

## AdaCAD 3

### Step 1: Download the Bitmap From AdaCAD

![file](./img/tc2_download.png)

You can download the draft by hovering your mouse over the [outlet](../glossary/outlet.md) of the draft you'd like you download and select "download as bitmap." The bitmap exported from AdaCAD uses a .jpg format (because we haven't figured out a way to download directly to BMP or TIFF just yet). You need to formally convert the .jpg that AdaCAD generates to a bitmap format for it to be read, which we show in the next step.

### Step 2: Reformat as a .TIFF file in Photoshop


Each draft created in AdaCAD can be exported as a bitmap image, however, the files exported need to be processed to be converted into true bitmap that can be read by the TC2. This can be accomplished by opening the bitmap generated by AdaCAD in Photoshop, selecting Image->Mode->Greyscale:

Then, selecting Image->Mode->Bitmap. Selecting the bitmap mode will ask you to agree to flatten layers (say OK), then will give you options for resolution. Set resolution to the automatic value (72 Pixels/Inch) and then for the "Method" category, select "50% Threshold". This will take any pixel that is more than 50% black, and make it black, and any that is less than 50% black, and make it white.

Then hit "Save As" and select "TIFF" as the format and you are ready to use this file on your TC2.
