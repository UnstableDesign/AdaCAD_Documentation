## Language Choice

AdaCAD is ultimately a tool for constructing woven [drafts](./draft). When developing this project, we found ourselves questioning which language to use in our design: the language of programming (which sees a draft as a grid of cells) or the language of [looms](./loom) and [cloth](./cloth) (which sees a draft as a list of instructions for a human-machine to perform). In the end, we decided to use a mix of all languages, but, whenever possible, to stick to the following commitments:

1. To describe drafts from the perspective of what the loom will be doing (e.g. heddle lift or lower) 
2. Whenever possible, maintain the primacy of the material in what will ultimately be woven. Specifically, not to claim that the draft is the final form the cloth will take, but instead, is a set of instructions which materials will animate to different effects.

### Weaving Terms
- [bitmap image](./bitmap-image.md) : a digital format for representing a woven draft
- [cloth](./cloth) : what weaving makes 
- [direct tie (or dobby) loom](./direct-tie-loom) : a kind of loom
- [draft](./draft) : instructions provided to loom and weaver to create a piece of cloth
- [drawdown](./drawdown) : an abstraction representing the structure of cloth
- [end](./end) : a way to refer to a single warp in the cloth
- [harness loom](./harness-loom) : a kind of loom
- [jacquard loom](./jacquard-loom) : a kind of loom
- [loom](./loom) : an apparatus for producing woven cloth
- [pick](./pick) : a single insertion of a weft into the cloth
- [structure](./structure) : families of drafts that give rise to cloth with specific textures and mechanical properties
- [warp lowered](./warp-lowered) : a warp threaded through a heddle that is not raised (and represented as a white cell in the draft)
- [warp raised](./warp-raised) : a warp threaded through a heddle that is raised by the loom (and represented as a white cell in the draft)
- [warp system](./warp-system) : a conceptual category that is used to identify which warps in the cloth operate as units or groups to produce particular effects in the cloth. 
- [warp](./warp) : a term that refers to the collection of yarns tensioned across the loom. 
- [weft system](./weft-system) : a conceptual category that is used to identify which wefts in the cloth operate as units or groups to produce particular effects in the cloth. 
- [weft](./weft) : a term that refers to the collection of yarns worked into the cloth during weaving.


### AdaCAD Specific Terms
- [inlet](./inlet) : a term that describes the user interface element where one can provide drafts to an AdaCAD operation
- [layer notation](./layer-notation) : a text-based notation for relating different warp and weft systems to different cloth layers
- [operation](./operation) : a function that transforms one or more input drafts into modified output drafts.
- [outlet](./outlet) : : a term that describes the user interface element that allows the selected draft to be routed to different operation inputs. 
- [parameter](./parameter) : a variable provided to the operation that determines how the draft transformation function takes place. 
- [parametric design](./parametric-design.md) :  a form of design that creates dataflows between different parameterized operations to generate new outputs, in this case, weave drafts.
