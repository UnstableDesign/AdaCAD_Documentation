# Harness Loom

A horizontal loom on which each [warp](warp) yarn is threaded through a heddle, and each heddle is attached to one of a given set of "harnesses" "frames" or "shafts". When a harness is raised, so too are the heddles and warps within those frames. Harness looms can come with sets of two to 32 harnesses.

We use the term "harness" loom to represent looms that control the lifting and lowering of shafts using a tie-up and treadling system. These looms are controlled by foot or hand pedals that are attached (or "tied") to different sets of shafts. The pedals are pressed in sequence to result in different cloth patterns.
