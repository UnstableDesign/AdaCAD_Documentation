<!--![file](./img/undulatewefts.png)-->
## Parameters
- tbd
## Description
Given a user specified input of a series of number, it shifts every pic by the value specified in the corresponding location of the user specified input. For example, if 1 3 1 is entered, it shifts the first pic to the right by 1, second to the right by 3, third by 1
## Application
This can be used to create structures that respond to non-linear shift patterns. It could also allow someone to enter a data stream into the input field representing data values, and have the structures generated reflect those values
