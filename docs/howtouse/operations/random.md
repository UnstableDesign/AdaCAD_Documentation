## Parameters
- `ends`: the number of ends in the structure
- `pics`: the number of pics in the structure
- `percent warp raised`: a number from 0-100 representing the desired ratio of raised to lowered warps. Lower numbers are more weft facing, higher numbers are more warp faced. 

## Description
Generates a draft of the size specified where the value of each interlacement is generated randomly.

:::note
structures generated by the random operation may not have interlacements in every end and pick.
:::


## Application
We don't know of current random draft generators, so this one is just for the fun of applying code-based random number generators to weaving structures
