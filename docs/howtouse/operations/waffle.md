## Description
Waffle weave is a twill-based structure in which warp and weft floats of increasing and then decreasing lengths are bound by a border of tabby interlacements to create a grid of cells. There is typically an equal number of pics and ends in a single pattern unit. This operation generates waffle structures based on specifying the longest float and number of binding rows to surround each waffle. 


## Parameters
- `float length`: the length of the longest float in the waffle structure. Must be an odd number (and if even, will round down to the closest odd number)
- `binding rows`: this the number of tabby borders around the central diamond. 
- `packing`: crops the structure to control how tightly the floating regions in the design will be packed together when tiled. 



## Application
Generates a waffle  structure that can be modified as needed as ones design evolves.
