# all possible structures

## Parameters
- `size`: a number that represents the number of ends and pics in the structure (3 or 4 only)
- `selection`: the id number of the structure to display. 

## Description
This operation generates a list of every possible valid structure for a draft of a given size and allows the user to iterate through that list. We define valid as having at least one interlacement in every warp end and weft pick. Selecting size 4 creates 22874 valid structures. You can enter any `selection` number between 1-22874 to see the structure associated with that number. 

#### Application
Using this to generate tie-ups for 4-shaft drafts or profile drafts helps visualize variations of the drawdown based on changes in the tieup.
