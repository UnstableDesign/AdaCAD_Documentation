# cutout
<!--![file](./img/cutout.png)-->
## Parameters
- tbd
## Description
Applies binary math to two drafts. To do so, it looks at each interlacement in input drafts a and b. If a and b are both marked as having warped raised, it changes the value to warp lowered, effectively cutting the black cells in b from a. This is the opposite of mask
## Application
No established application, but a fun way to see how to apply binary math to the production of drafts.
