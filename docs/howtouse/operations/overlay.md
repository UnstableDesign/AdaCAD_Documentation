# overlay
<!--![file](./img/overlay.png)-->
## Parameters
- tbd
## Description
Applies binary math to two drafts. To do so, it looks at each interlacement in input drafts a and b. If either interlacement a or b are marked as warp lifted, the resulting draft will have a warp raised in that location. 
## Application
No established application, but a fun way to see how to apply binary math to the production of drafts. Retains the pattern of raised warp ends (black cells) from each input draft when they are overlaid. (Keeps any region that is marked black/true in either draft)
