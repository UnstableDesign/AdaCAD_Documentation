## Parameters
- `undulation pattern`: a series of numbers that specify how far to shift each weft end down. 

## Description
Given a user specified input of a series of number, it shifts every end by the value specified in the corresponding location of the user specified input. For example, if 1 3 1 is entered, it shifts the first end to the down by 1, second to the down by 3, third down by 1
## Application
This can be used to create structures that respond to non-linear shift patterns. It could also allow someone to enter a data stream into the input field representing data values, and have the structures generated reflect those values
