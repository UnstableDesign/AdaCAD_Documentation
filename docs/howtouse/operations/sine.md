# sine wave sample
![file](./img/sine.png)


## Description
A sine wave is a mathematical function that produces values that repeats periodically over a given time window. When visualized, it looks like smooth curves traveling over and under a midpoint. In AdaCAD, a sine way is determines the position of a single interlacement along the ends of a structure.

## Parameters
- `ends`: the number of ends wide to make the resulting structure
- `amplitude`: the number of picks tall for this structure. We use the term "amplitude" here to align with the conventional naming for sine functions
- `frequency`: the frequency of a wave, such as a sine way describes the number of times the wave travels over and under its midpoint in a given time span. In music, this frequency results in a tone but in this function, it results in the interlacements being described along the amplitude.


## Application
While not an established weaving technique, the production of sine waves can produce really interesting threading and treadling patterns.
