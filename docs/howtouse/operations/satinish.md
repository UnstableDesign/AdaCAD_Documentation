# satinish
![file](./img/satinish.png)
## Parameters
- `pattern`: a sequence of numbers, separated by a space, that describes the repeating pattern. For example, 2 2 3 3 creates the repeating pattern of having 2 warps raised, then 2 lowered, then 3 raised, then 3 lowered. 
- `shift`: the number of warps to shift the structure on each subsequent pick. 
- `S/Z`: determines the direction of the shift on each row. 

## Description
Generates a structure by shifting the first row (described by the input string), the number of shifts specified on each row. This operation interprets the  term "satin" loosely as a repeating pic that is shifted 1 or more positions on each successive pic. 

## Application
Allows for the creation and customization of satin or steep twill structures by shifting more than 1 end to the left or right on each subsequence pic.
