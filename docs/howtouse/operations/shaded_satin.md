# shaded satin
![file](./img/shaded_satin.png)
## Parameters
- `pattern`: a sequence of numbers, separated by a space, that describes the repeating pattern. For example, 2 2 3 3 creates the repeating pattern of having 2 warps raised, then 2 lowered, then 3 raised, then 3 lowered. 
- `shift`: the number of warps to shift the structure on each subsequent pick. 
- `S/Z`: determines the direction of the shift on each row.

## Description
Satin is a family of weave structures that create cloth with weft floats on one face of the fabric and warp floats on the other. The succeeding interlacements of warp and weft threads in each row occur on non-adjacent warp threads, creating a smooth surface of floating threads on each face. The number of ends between succeeding warp interlacements is consistent in each row (i.e. a 2/8 satin will have one raised warp end followed by a weft float over 8 warp ends in each row). Shaded satins typically use more than just one raised warp on each pic to control the visibility of the warp or weft colors proportionally. 

## Application
Generates a satin or shaded satin structure that can be modified as needed as ones design evolves. Shaded satins are often used to create gradient color effects between the warp and weft colorways.
