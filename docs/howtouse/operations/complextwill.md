# complex twill
![file](./img/complextwill.png)

## Parameters
- `pattern`: a sequence of numbers, separated by a space, that describes the repeating pattern. For example, 2 2 3 3 creates the repeating pattern of having 2 warps raised, then 2 lowered, then 3 raised, then 3 lowered. 
- `S/Z`: determines the direction of the twill produced

## Description
In this context, a complex twill is a straight twill with multiple ratios of interlacement in a single structure unit so that a 2 2 3 3 pattern describes a structure with two raised warp ends, two lowered ends, three raised ends, and three lowered ends. Each successive pic begins the same pattern of interlacement on an adjacent warp end, creating a diagonal pattern.

## Application
Generates a complex twill structure that can be modified as needed as ones design evolves.
