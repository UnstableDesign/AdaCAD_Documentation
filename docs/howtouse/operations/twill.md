- `warps raised`: the number of warps raised along a base pattern pic 
- `warps lowered`: the number of lowered warps along the base pattern pic
- `S/Z`:  determines the direction of the twill produced.
- `facing`: a toggle to determine if the twill should be predominantly warp facing or weft facing. 

## Description
Twill is a family of weave structures in which weft picks pass over or under one or more warp threads in a repeating pattern. The same interlacement sequence begins on an adjacent warp end, either to the left or right, in the next weft row, creating a diagonal pattern of interlacement.

## Application
Generates a twill or twill derivative structure that can be modified as needed as ones design evolves.
