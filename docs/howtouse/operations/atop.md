<!--![file](./img/atop.png)-->
## Parameters
- tbd
## Description
Applies binary math to two drafts. To do so, it looks at each interlacement in input drafts a and b. If a is marked warp raised and b marked warp lowered, or vice versa, it sets the corresponding interlacement in the output draft to warp raised.
## Application
No established application, but a fun way to see how to apply binary math to the production of drafts.
