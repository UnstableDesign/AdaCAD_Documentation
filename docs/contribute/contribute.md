# Contribute
<div class="emph">
We aim to grow a vibrant and active community for experimental weaving. To do this, we need your help and we've outlined a number of ways that you can contribute to this mission. We've organized a few ideas based on the different kinds of people we see in our eco-system:

- Run a small study group or a virtual meeting to teach others. 


## Computer Programmers
- See if there are  [Github Issues](https://github.com/UnstableDesign/AdaCAD/issues) that you can help support
- [Write your own](../develop/makeanoperation) features or operations to extend the software
- Share your explorations with drafting and weaving on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/Be7ukQcvrC)
- Ask questions about weaving on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Be7ukQcvrC)
- Consider linking up with another community member to develop a custom feature for their practice. 

## Educators
- Share your experiences integrating AdaCAD into your teaching on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Be7ukQcvrC) or via email to unstabledesignlab@gmail.com.
- Share any resources or materials that you have developed to support your teaching [Discord](https://discord.gg/Be7ukQcvrC) or via email to unstabledesignlab@gmail.com.
- Encourage your students to join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/Be7ukQcvrC) community and share their work. 

## Researchers 
- Cite AdaCAD in your publications: *Laura Devendorf, Kathryn Walters, Marianne Fairbanks, Etta Sandry, and Emma R Goodwill. 2023. AdaCAD: Parametric Design as a New Form of Notation for Complex Weaving. In Proceedings of the 2023 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI '23). Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA, Article 127, 1â€“18. https://doi.org/10.1145/3544548.3581571*
- Consider extending AdaCAD to support your research and engage a larger community of open-minded weavers and coders -- (e.g. consider how you might use AdaCAD as in the "broader impacts" of NSF grants.) If budgets allow, reach out to ask about sub-awards or collaborations that could be of mutual support to our team and yours.
- Pose interesting questions and challenges to [Discord](https://discord.gg/Be7ukQcvrC) for the community to think about!

## Guild Members
- consider hosting AdaCAD focused study groups and/or share the outcomes of projects and explorations with AdaCAD on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Be7ukQcvrC)

## Historians and/or Curators
- consider how AdaCAD might be used as a way to access archival materials in ways that can be easily explored and modified by other weavers.  
- Share upcoming exhibitions and projects that you are part of (or that you are excited about) on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Be7ukQcvrC)
