# Donate
To date, AdaCAD has been supported entirely via National Science Foundation grants. Sustaining AdaCAD into the future will require more diverse forms of funding support. If you are able to financially support our project and community, please consider making a gift to our research fund via the University of Colorado Boulder.

To help you decide if and how you can contribute, consider the amounts and uses below: 

- $25 - buy us a coffee
- $100 - support the development of a new virtual workshop
- $1,000 - sponsor a micro-residency focused on developing new documentation and features for AdaCAD
- $2,500 - sponsor a talk series
- $15,000 - support a 3-month artist residency 
- $25,000 - support a PhD student so they can focus on AdaCAD related work for their PhD thesis

If you are able to offer sustaining forms of support (e.g. endowed talk series, scholarships or PhD positions) please contact us directly at unstabledesignlab@gmail.com. 

While we hope to have a more streamlined process for donation soon, if you are interested and in a position to support, please do contact us at unstabledesignlab@gmail.com.
