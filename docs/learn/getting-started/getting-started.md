# Getting Started
<div class="emph">
At a high level, using AdaCAD involves the following steps: 
</div>

1. **Open an AdaCAD Workspace:** To start using AdaCAD, visit [adacad.org](https://adacad.org/). Looking for an older version of AdaCAD? Find it on the [compare versions](../../reference/compare-versions.md) page. You can also learn more about the [interface](../../reference/interface/index.md) in our Reference section.

2. **Create a Draft:** There are two ways you can make a draft in AdaCAD: Using traditional point paper drafting in our [draft editor](../../reference/interface/draft_editor.md) or by [dataflow drafting](../../reference/glossary/dataflow.md) in the [workspace](../../reference/interface/workspace.md) You can switch between these two modes by using the "design mode" toggle in the [top bar](../../reference/interface/topbar.md). 

3. **Weave the Draft:** Once you have created a draft, weave it on your loom. You can export drafts from AdaCAD to upload to computerized looms such as the [TC2](../tutorials/weave_tc2.md) or [AVL CompuDobby Loom](../tutorials/weave_avl.md). You can also manually follow patterns to setup analog looms.

4. **Contribute:** We'd love to see what you made and to share it with the community. The best way to do this is to join the [AdaCAD Discord Community](https://discord.com/invite/Be7ukQcvrC) and share it via the 'project sharing' channel. Alternatively, you can email your design and creation to unstabledesignlab@gmail.com or share it on Instagram by tagging [#adacad](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/adacad/).
