    ## Wednesday, March 19 2025, 9am-10am Mountain Time
     Getting Started with AdaCAD
     <div class="card-dx"> This workshop will introduce you to our [interface](../reference/interface/index.md), including both the [workspace](../reference/interface/workspace.md) and [draft editor](../reference/interface/draft_editor.md), and help you create your first [dataflow](../reference/glossary/dataflow.md). Attendees will be guided through the activity and will have time for asking questions and answers. The workshop will be recorded and shared after the event. This workshop will assume that attendees have a basic understanding of weaving and drafting.</div>

    ## Wednesday, April 16 2025, 9am-10am Mountain Time
    Weaving Imagery in AdaCAD
     <div class="card-dx"> We'll walk you through the process of creating [dataflows](../reference/glossary/dataflow.md) for assigning shaded structures like [`shaded satin`](../reference/operations/shaded_satin.md) to regions of an image using the [`image map`](../reference/operations/imagemap.md) operation. Additionally, we'll help you format these drafts for weaving on TC2 digital looms.</div>

    ## Wednesday, May 14 2025, 9am-10am Mountain Time
    Drafting for Harness and Dobby
     <div class="card-dx"> We'll walk you through the process of creating [dataflows](../reference/glossary/dataflow.md) that produce patterned threading sequences using the [`pattern across width`](../reference/operations/warp_profile.md) operation. We'll then use the [`generate drawdown`](../reference/operations/drawdown.md) operation to combine these threadings with treadling and tieup drafts. </div>
