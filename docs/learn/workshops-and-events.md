## Past Workshops
Workshops will offer lessons where the project team guides you though an activity for performing a specific task or workflow in AdaCAD. Each workshop will include follow-along instruction and space for questions and answers. **You can download the the PDF we created to guide the activities here: [Spring 2025 Workshop Guide](/pdf/Spring2025_WorkshopGuide.pdf)**




### Getting Started with AdaCAD
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xS_DZB3A7yY?si=cmHKwgjEoVcpGodZ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This workshop will introduce you to our [interface](../reference/interface/index.md), including both the [workspace](../reference/interface/workspace.md) and [draft editor](../reference/interface/draft_editor.md), and help you create your first [dataflow](../reference/glossary/dataflow.md). Attendees will be guided through the activity and will have time for asking questions and answers. The workshop will be recorded and shared after the event. This workshop will assume that attendees have a basic understanding of weaving and drafting.




 ### Weaving Imagery

We'll walk you through the process of creating [dataflows](../reference/glossary/dataflow.md) for assigning shaded structures like [`shaded satin`](../reference/operations/shaded_satin.md) to regions of an image using the [`image map`](../reference/operations/imagemap.md) operation. Additionally, we'll help you format these drafts for weaving on TC2 digital looms.



### Drafting for Harness Looms

We'll walk you through the process of creating [dataflows](../reference/glossary/dataflow.md) that produce patterned threading sequences using the [`pattern across width`](../reference/operations/warp_profile.md) operation. We'll then use the [`generate drawdown`](../reference/operations/drawdown.md) operation to combine these threadings with treadling and tieup drafts.
