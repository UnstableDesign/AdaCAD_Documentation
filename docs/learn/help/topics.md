## Settings 

### Set the Origin 
By default, AdaCAD assumes that all drafts begin in the top left corner (e.g. that the first pic and end of the weave are represented by the topmost and leftmost cell on the draft). You can change the origin of your drafts by clicking the <FAIcon icon="fa-solid fa-gear" size="1x" /> the [topbar](../../reference/interface/topbar.md). 

### Switching Drafting Modes
AdaCAD supports two modes of drafting. In [workspace](../../reference/interface/workspace.md) mode, you generate drafts by creating [dataflows](../../reference/glossary/dataflow.md). In the [draft editor](../../reference/interface/draft_editor.md) mode you can generate drafts following the traditional style of clicking cells on point paper. You can toggle between the two modes by selecting the corresponding mode name on the [topbar](../../reference/interface/topbar.md) of AdaCAD. 

Additionally, you can move between the [workspace](../../reference/interface/workspace.md) and [draft editor](../../reference/interface/draft_editor.md). You can edit any draft in a dataflow by double clicking the draft or clicking the <FAIcon icon="fa-solid fa-ellipsis" size="1x" /> and then selecting <FAIcon icon="fa-solid fa-edit" size="1x" /> Open in Editor from the menu.
