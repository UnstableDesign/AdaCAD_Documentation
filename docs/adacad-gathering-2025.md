The AdaCAD Gathering will take place June 2-6, 2025 in Boulder Colorado. This Working Group is supported by a [National Science Foundation grant](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2346150&HistoricalAwards=false) focused on transitioning the AdaCAD open-source weaving software into a larger and more diverse open-source “eco-system” of users, developers, and maintainers. With this support, we are able to cover the costs of your flight, hotel, and meals for the duration of the trip.

This group will bring together ~10 experts from art, craft, open-source, and engineering to co-author founding documents, workshop governance structures, and establish policies that will found our eco-system and help AdaCAD function as a community owned and maintained tool. We especially want to develop a thoughtful and sustainable approach for weavers (and the weave-curious) to connect, share, and collaborate.

The tentative schedule for the working group is included below and would take place over five days, with two days devoted to arrival/departure and three days focused on group activities. While the impetus for the gathering is AdaCAD, we are planning activities that could be useful to participants more broadly. We also intend to keep the working schedule humane so that we can build connections and think creatively about open-source/craft futures.

## About Boulder

Boulder is a walkable/bikeable city and your hotel will be within walking distance of the university. Thus, you will not need to rent a car. If you'd like to explore Boulder, the bike paths are robust, extensive and off-street. You can rent an hourly bike using Boulder's B-Cycle program. The bus lines run regularly in Boulder as well.

### High Altitude
Boulder is 5,430 feet/1,655 meters above sea level. The weather can be erratic, the sun can be very strong, and the air is thin. Plan to wear sunblock, hat, sunglasses, and bring a bottle of water with you all day. Bring a wind breaker, rain coat, and maybe a light down jacket (it is rare but not impossible to get snow in June). A stray thunderstorm is likely in early June.
