# Research 

<div class="emph">
AdaCAD is part of an active and ongoing research project that includes the [Experimental Weaving Residency](https://unstable.design/experimental-weaving-resdiency/), the [Experimental Weaving Talk Series](https://unstable.design/experimental-weaving-talks/) and the [Experimental Textiles Course Curriculum](https://extx.unstable.design/). Collectively, these programs explore methods to bridge craft and engineering for the sake of creating more robust, sustainable, and aesthetically rich interactions with technology. The project is supported by National Science Foundation Grants [#2346150](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2346150&HistoricalAwards=false), [#1943109](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1943109), and [#1755587](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1755587).

### AdaCAD: Parametric Design as a New Form of Notation for Complex Weaving, CHI 2023
This paper, published at CHI in 2023, details the shift of AdaCAD to a parametric design framework and how those new features were taken up and extended in collaboration with Kathryn Walters, Etta Sandry and Marianne Fairbanks. We argue more broadly that parametric design can be seen as an evolved form of weaving notation that offers specific benefits for facilitating collaboration engineers and craftspeople.

### Loom Pedals: Retooling Jacquard Weaving for Improvisational Design Workflows, TEI 2024
This paper describes hardware and software extensions to AdaCAD and the TC2 looms that enable improvisational workflows. Specifically, it describes the design of pedals that connect to the loom so that someone can manipulate drafts as they weave, without having to redesign and reupload a new design file.
