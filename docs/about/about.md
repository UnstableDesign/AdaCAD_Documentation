# About

<div class="emph">
AdaCAD is an experimental workspace that applies [parametric design](/reference/glossary/parametric-design.md) to the domain of weave [drafting](/reference/glossary/draft.md). It supports algorithmic and playful approaches to developing woven structures and cloth, for [shaft](../reference/glossary/harness-loom.md), [dobby](../reference/glossary/direct-tie-loom.md),  and [jacquard](../reference/glossary/jacquard-loom.md) looms.

### üíª AdaCAD is freely accessible online (at [adacad.org](http://adacad.org))
You do not need to download or install it on your computer. We have tested it on some iPads but we recommend using the [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) browser on a laptop or desktop computer for the best experience. 

### üß™ aims to support "experimental weavers"
"Experimental weavers" is a term we use to describe weavers, engineers looking to develop woven based applications, and creative coders. We use this umbrella term to acknowledge that many of our users occupy multiple categories simultaneously. 


### ü•∞ is [open source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) 
The application, source code and documentation are all publicly accessible. Furthermore, these resources are open to improvement and modification from community members. Someone can write code to [create their own operations](../develop/makeanoperation.md) or help the project documentation can make changes to this website using a Markdown editor. These contributions are made through [Github](https://github.com/UnstableDesign/AdaCAD). If you just want to learn more, get to know AdaCAD users, and share your projects and workspaces, we encourage you to join our [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/uv2HuuFj).

### üç∞ is Homemade
AdaCAD was first developed and 2017 and is maintained by Laura Devendorf and the [Unstable Design Lab](https://unstable.design/) with input and [contributions](./contributors.md) by a broader community of experimental weavers. **It is "homemade" software made by curious weaver/coders so bugs and oddities may emerge**. You can help the project by reporting any bugs you find via [GitHub](https://github.com/UnstableDesign/AdaCAD/issues), by posting to the [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/uv2HuuFj), or by writing to us at unstabledesignlab (at) gmail.com.   


### üëØ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è is named after inspiring ladies named Ada
We originally named the project AdaCAD as a nod to [Ada Lovelace](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/ada-lovelace-the-first-tech-visionary). CAD is an acronym for Computer-Aided Design. We pronounce it AY-da-cad. In reference to charles Babbage's Analytical Engine, Ada Lovelace famously wrote that "The Analytical Engine weaves algebraic patterns, just as the Jacquard loom weaves flowers and leaves". We chose the name to mark the continued evolution of algebra, algorithm and cloth that have been explored by weavers and coders, from Ada Lovelace to [Ada Dietz](https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/patterns/weaving/monographs/dak_alge.pdf).
