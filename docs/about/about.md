# About
AdaCAD is an experimental workspace that applies [parametric design](/reference/glossary/parametric-design.md) to the domain of weave [drafting](/reference/glossary/draft.md). It supports algorithmic and playful approaches to developing woven structures and cloth, for [shaft](../reference/glossary/harness-loom.md), [dobby](../reference/glossary/direct-tie-loom.md),  and [jacquard](../reference/glossary/jacquard-loom.md) looms. 

**AdaCAD is freely accessible online** (at [adacad.org](adacad.org)), you do not need to download or install it on your computer. We recommend using the [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) browser on a laptop or desktop computer for the best experience. We are also continually updating AdaCAD to experiment with new features, which means that there is [more than one version of AdaCAD that you can choose from](../../getting-started/compare_versions.md). 

**AdaCAD aims to support weavers, engineers looking to develop woven based applications, and creative coders.** We refer to all of these parties as "experimental weavers" to acknowledge the fact that many of our uses occupy multiple categories simultaneously. 


**AdaCAD is [open source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source), which means that the application, source code and documentation are all publicly accessible.** Furthermore, these resources are open to improvement and modification from community members. Someone who codes can write typescript to create their own operations and someone who wants to help the project documentation can make changes to this website using a Markdown editor. These contributions are made through [Github](https://github.com/UnstableDesign/AdaCAD). If you just want to learn more, get to know AdaCAD users, and share your projects and workspaces, we encourage you to join our [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/uv2HuuFj).


AdaCAD was first developed and 2017 and is maintained by Laura Devendorf and the [Unstable Design Lab](https://unstable.design/) with input and [contributions](./contributors.md) by a broader community of experimental weavers. **It is "homemade" software made by curious weaver/coders so bugs and oddities may emerge** You can help the project by reporting any bugs you find via [GitHub](https://github.com/UnstableDesign/AdaCAD/issues), by posting to the [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/uv2HuuFj), or by writing to us at unstabledesignlab (at) gmail.com.   


## Why is it called AdaCAD 
We originally named the project AdaCAD as a nod to Ada Lovelace. CAD is an acronym for Computer-Aided Design. We pronounce it eh-duh-cad. In reference to charles Babbage's Analytical Engine (which is often considered the first computer), Ada Lovelace famously wrote that "The Analytical Engine weaves algebraic patterns, just as the Jacquard loom weaves flowers and leaves". We chose the name to mark the continued evolution of algebra, algorithm and cloth that have been explored by weavers and coders, from Ada Lovelace to Ada Dietz.
