Also known as plain weave. Plain weave is one of the most basic weave structures in which each weft thread passes over one warp end and under one warp end; the next weft pick follows the pattern on the alternate warp threads (over/under/over/under). Tabby variations include basket weave, rib weave, and rep weave. These derivatives can be generated by modifying the parameters
