# Seed Draft


This term describes a draft that has been created directly by the user, rather than automatically by an operations in a dataflow. These are the only drafts in AdaCAD that can be directly edited by the user in the [editor interface](../../learn/getting-started/interface.md#interface-guide) and while they can be used as inputs to operations, their design is unaffected by changes in the dataflow.

 If you attempt to edit a draft that is created within the [dataflow](./dataflow.md) you will get a warning like the following:

Clicking "Enable Edits" copies the draft generated by this operation into a new "seed draft" that can be edited. This removes the draft from the dataflow, meaning that future changes to the dataflow will no longer affect this draft.
