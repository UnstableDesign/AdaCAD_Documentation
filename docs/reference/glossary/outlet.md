# Outlet
An outlet is a part of an [operation](./operation.md). Specifically, it used to form connections between nodes, such that the draft associated with the node connected to an [outlet](./outlet.md) can be used as input to this operation when it is connected to an operations [inlet](./inlet.md). Put another way, an inlet is a port that accepts input to an operation. The draft connected to the inlet is then manipulated by the operation.

A single outlet can be used to connect its associated draft to multiple inputs.
