# tabby
Also known as plain weave. Plain weave is one of the most basic weave structures in which each weft thread passes over one warp end and under one warp end; the next weft pick follows the pattern on the alternate warp threads (over/under/over/under). Tabby variations include basket weave, rib weave, and rep weave. These derivatives can be generated by modifying the parameters

- `base pics`: the number or repeats to make of the base pic.
- `alt pics`: the number of repeats to make of the opposite, or inverse, of the base pattern.
