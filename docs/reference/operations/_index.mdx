# Operations

AdaCAD offers over 50 [operations](../glossary/operation.md) that you can build into [dataflows](../glossary/dataflow.md) to generate drafts. This page groups operations by their function, previews their design, and links to the full details of each operation (which you can also find on the left sidebar).
