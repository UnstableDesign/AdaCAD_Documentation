## Parameters
- `ends`: the number of ends in the structure
- `pics`: the number of pics in the structure
- `min float length`: the shortest length of a weft float to include in this structure
- `max float length`: the longest length of a weft float to include in this structure
- `float length frequency`: a number from 0-100 representing if the algorithm should try to make on the shorter (0) or longer (100) end of the min and max values.
