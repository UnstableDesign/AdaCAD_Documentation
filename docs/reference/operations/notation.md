# notation
<!--![file](./img/notation.png)-->

## Description
Developed in collaboration with Kathryn Walters, this operation uses a notation system to assign drafts to different warp and weft patterns on different layers of cloth. Layers are represented by () so (1a)(2b) puts warp 1 and weft a on layer 1, warp 2 and weft b on layer 2. This function is slightly different than notation (assign by system) because it will apply a single input draft across all systems associated with a layer.

## Parameters
- tbd

## Application
This is used to create different structures, with different layer relationships, across an entire cloth. It becomes especially powerful with one changes layer numbers. For example (a1b2)(c2) will place the first layer across two systems, and the second layer across one system. This means that one can arbitrary change both layer order, as well as the association of different warp and weft systems to different layers across different regions of the cloth.
