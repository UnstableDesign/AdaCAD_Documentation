## Parameters
- `selected input` - controls which draft is passed through to the output. 1 connects to the draft attached to the first inlet, 2 connects to the draft attached to the second inlet, and so on. If you select a number that is higher than the number of drafts commented, an empty draft will pass through. 

## Inlets
- `draft` - accepts a single draft. Each time a draft is added, a new inlet will generate for another draft to attach. 

## Application
To control the draft that is supplied to a large number of inputs at once rather than having to add and remove individual connections
