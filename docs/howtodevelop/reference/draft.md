# Draft
Drafts in AdaCAD are containers for both a drawdown as well as information that can be used to interpret the drawdown. Each draft is assigned a unique ID `id` and will get a name generated by the operations that produced the draft, refered to by `gen_name`. Alternatively there can be a user defined name for the draft `ud_draft`. The drawdown `drawdown` contains the draft cells as a two-dimensional array of [Cells](./cell.md). The final values store information about which systems and materials are to be used on each row. 

`rowShuttleMapping` and `colShuttleMapping` refer to the materials assigned to each warp (col) and weft (row). The size of the array will be the same as the number or wefts and warps (respectively), and will store a number, corresponding to the ID of the shuttle (aka material) being used in that weft or warp. The materials (which are called shuttles, strangely, in the code) and their ids are stored in the MaterialsService: [/core/provider/materials.service.ts](https://github.com/UnstableDesign/AdaCAD/blob/main/src/app/core/provider/materials.service.ts)

`rowSystemMapping` and `colSystemMapping` refer to the systems assigned to each warp (col) and weft (row). The size of the array will be the same as the number or wefts and warps (respectively), and will store a number, corresponding to the ID of the system assigned to that weft or warp. The  list of systems and their ids can be found in the SystemsService: [/core/provider/systems.service.ts](https://github.com/UnstableDesign/AdaCAD/blob/main/src/app/core/provider/systems.service.ts)




```jsx title="src/app/core/model/datatypes.js"
export interface Draft{
  id: number,
  gen_name: string,
  ud_name: string,
  drawdown: Drawdown,
  rowShuttleMapping: Array<number>,
  rowSystemMapping: Array<number>,
  colShuttleMapping: Array<number>,
  colSystemMapping: Array<number>,
}

```

There are a number of helper features to assist in easily getting, setting, and reading cell values in a file located at: [/core/model/drafts.js](https://github.com/UnstableDesign/AdaCAD/blob/main/src/app/core/model/drafts.ts)
