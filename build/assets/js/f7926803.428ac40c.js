We define valid as having at least one interlacement in every warp end and weft pick. Selecting size 4 creates 22874 valid structures.

Each successive pic begins the same pattern of interlacement on an adjacent warp end, creating a diagonal pattern.","permalink":"/docs/reference/operations/complextwill"},{"id":"reference/operations/glitchsatin","title":"glitch satin","description":"This experimental function was designed to algorithmically generate structures that resemble satins that include non-repeating units.","permalink":"/docs/reference/operations/glitchsatin"},{"id":"reference/operations/random","title":"random","description":"Generates a draft of the size specified where the value of each interlacement is generated randomly.","permalink":"/docs/reference/operations/random"},{"id":"reference/operations/satin","title":"satin","description":"Satin is a family of weave structures that create cloth with weft floats on one face of the fabric and warp floats on the other. The succeeding interlacements of warp and weft threads in each row occur on non-adjacent warp threads, creating a smooth surface of floating threads on each face. The number of ends between succeeding warp interlacements is consistent in each row (i.e. a 1/8 satin will have one raised warp end followed by a weft float over 8 warp ends in each row).","permalink":"/docs/reference/operations/satin"},{"id":"reference/operations/satinish","title":"satin-ish","description":"Generates a structure by shifting the first row (described by the input string), the number of shifts specified on each row.

The number of ends between succeeding warp interlacements is consistent in each row (i.e. a 2/8 satin will have one raised warp end followed by a weft float over 8 warp ends in each row). Shaded satins typically use more than just one raised warp on each pic to control the visibility of the warp or weft colors proportionally.","permalink":"/docs/reference/operations/shaded_satin"},{"id":"reference/operations/sine","title":"sine wave sample","description":"A sine wave is a mathematical function that produces values that repeats periodically over a given time window.

Plain weave is one of the most basic weave structures in which each weft thread passes over one warp end and under one warp end; the next weft pick follows the pattern on the alternate warp threads (over/under/over/under). Tabby variations include basket weave, rib weave, and rep weave. These derivatives can be generated by modifying the parameters","permalink":"/docs/reference/operations/tabbyder"},{"id":"reference/operations/twill","title":"twill","description":"Twill is a family of weave structures in which weft picks pass over or under one or more warp threads in a repeating pattern.
