In this example, our sensor is made by way of a conductive felt: when the felt is compressed, the conductive fibers come into close contact, thereby reducing electrical resistance. When released, the fibers return to their uncompressed state with a relatively high electrical resistance. The woven structure serves as a container for the felt. Specifically, the woven structure creates a felt sandwich whereby the top and bottom of the pocket contain separate conductive traces (one on top and one on bottom) and the felt in the middle changes resistance. When we connect a multimeter to the conductive yarns integrated into the top and bottom of the pocket, we can measure the changes in resistance when the pocket is pressed.
