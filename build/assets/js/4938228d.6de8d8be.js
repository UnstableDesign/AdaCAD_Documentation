In parallel, the three of them interviewed other e- and smart textiles designers to learn more about their process and workflow and we combined all of those insights into the very first iteration of AdaCAD, which resembled a traditional point paper editor with some specific supports for e- and smart textiles like viewing specific yarn paths, specifying conductive yarns, and designing in different layers.

We continued working with this version of AdaCAD for the next year or two and began to see some limitations of the design. Feedback from Members of the Rocky Mountain Handweavers Guild  who tried it expressed that it wasn't offering anything more than existing tools such as WeavePoint or iWeaveIt. At the same time, Laura and others in the lab (including now ",(0,n.jsx)(t.a,{href:"/docs/about/",children:"Sasha de Koninck"})," and multitalented undergraduate researcher ",(0,n.jsx)(t.a,{href:"/docs/about/",children:"Emma Goodwill"}),") became more advanced weavers and began to see that the challenge in developing robust e- textiles was not the integration of a metal yarn, but a deeper understanding of the mechanics that different weave structures afford. During a meeting to discuss the AdaCAD project with Belinda Rose and Vibeke Vestby, Belinda described how she used a tool called ",(0,n.jsx)(t.a,{href:"http://www.proweave.com/",children:"ProWeave"}),', which had a drag-and-drop style of generating drafts. This meeting shifted Laura to see a new possibility for the software, one that diverged from the point-paper approach to design to think about how a designer might "grow" drafts by connecting different draft manipulating components. This resonated with the way that Laura conceptualized and designed drafts, which always saw the relationships of interlacements or bindings in a cloth as specific algorithmic manipulations (e.g. a twill is a pick that is continually shifted to the right or left, two faced twill can be created by interlacing a twill and its inverse, shifting the inverse draft a few ends ot the left or right to distribute the bindings). With this and during the isolation of the COVID lockdown, Laura began to prototype and develop this vision, ultimately leading to AdaCAD 3.0.']}),"\n",(0,n.jsxs)(t.p,{children:["Concurrently, the Unstable Design Lab continued running it's Experimental Weaving Residency and Laura and the AdaCAD became more knowledgeable of the practices and approaches of advanced weavers.

As we presented the new design, we also received stronger feedback from the community.
