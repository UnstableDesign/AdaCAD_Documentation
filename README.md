# AdaCAD Documentation

This repository holds the content that is mirrored on https://docs.adacad.org. The website is built using [Docusaurus 3](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.


## AdaCAD Documentation
If you notice a missing page or would like ot make edits to an entry, you can do so by locating the page you'd like to change at https://docs.adacad.org and clicking the "edit this page" button. That will bring you to github where you will be able to edit, then "commit" that edit, and then submit a "pull request" for the organizers to review and integrate the edit. 

## The information below is for people who want to work on the site on their local computer. 

### Installation
Pull the repository to your local machine and then run:

```
$ npm install
```

### Local Development

```
$ npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service. Currently, the site is hosted at docs.adacad.org which is owned by Laura.
